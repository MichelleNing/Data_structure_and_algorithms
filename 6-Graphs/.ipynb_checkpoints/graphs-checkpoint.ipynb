    "\n",
    "The purpose of Graphs is to show how different things are connected to another. It also sometimes called Network. Tree is a more specific tyoe of graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a valid graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='graph-1.png' width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can really start from anywhere, you follow some path back to the start. Since cycle: A, B, C, D, E, F, A is possible, graph has root and nodes like trees do. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='graph-2.png' width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Image this above graph is a soccial network. It is clear the node is people, But the edges between people could be describing any connections. Maybe it's people met each other, or people who lived in the same city at the same time, or people worked on a project together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notes can contain many data, like people's full name, where they live now, what's their birthday, ect. Edges can contain data too. Sometimes, it contains the strength data of connections. Like how many times in the past week, people talked to each other. \n"

    "**Directed Graph**\n",

    "Directed graph is a kind of praph where edges have direction. For travel graph, it is easy to find where you trval start and where you trval to. If made around trip, it have two edges between same two nodes. One presents each way people travel.\n",

    "**Weakly Connected**\n",
    "\n",
    "A directed graph is weakly connected when only replacing all of the directed edges with undirected edges can cause it to be connected. Imagine that your graph has several vertices with one outbound edge, meaning an edge that points from it to some other vertex in the graph. There's no way to reach all of those vertices from any other vertex in the graph, but if those edges were changed to be undirected all vertices would be easily accessible. \n",

However, these information in the list are slid in a different way. If there is a edge between two nodes, 1 goes into the array. If no edge, 0 goes into the array. A single edge shows twice in the array. "
